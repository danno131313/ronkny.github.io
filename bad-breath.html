            <p>Bad breath, called Halitosis by medical professionals, can be caused by bad dental health. It can also be caused by the foods that you eat and an unhealthy lifestyle.</p>
            <p>If you don’t brush and floss, food particles and other debris build up in your mouth, causing bacteria to grow between your teeth, around your gums, and on your tongue. This also happens if you don’t clean your dentures properly. In addition, smoking and chewing can also cause bad breath, among other health problems. Cavities, infections, and dry mouth have also been shown to cause bad breath.</p>

    <p>Bad breath can also be a sign of a bigger problem: gum disease, also called periodontal disease. This is caused by the buildup of plaque, which leads to bacteria and toxins forming on your teeth. If left untreated, gum disease can do serious damage to your gums and jawbone.</p>
