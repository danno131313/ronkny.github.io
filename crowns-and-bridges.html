    <h1>Crowns and Bridges</h1>
    <h3>Crowns</h3>
    <p>Here at Bellingham Smiles, we are proud to offer crowns to our patients.</p>
    <p>If you have missing or cracked teeth, you are probably not happy with your smile. We are here to help you feel better about your mouth so you enjoy showing it off.</p>
    <p>One way we can do this is by offering crowns to our patients. A crown covers up a bad tooth so you have a natural-looking tooth that fits right into your mouth.</p>
    <p>Crowns are also used to keep a filling in place when there is not much tooth left. They can also strengthen your regular teeth by giving them extra protection. If you have discolored teeth or teeth that are misshapen, a crown will help you have a smile of which you can be proud.</p>
    <p>Crowns are attached right to your teeth so you will be able to do everything you can do with normal teeth. You can eat all of the foods you enjoy, no matter how hard it is to bite.</p>
    <p>Many different types of crowns are available, so we will be happy to discuss your options so you can be happy with your new smile.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about crowns or think you may benefit from having one, don’t hesitate to contact our office today at (360) 671-4552.</p>
    <h3>Bridges</h3>
    <p>Here at Bellingham Smiles, we also offer bridges to our patients.</p>
    <p>Many patients lose teeth as they age. This can actually change the way your mouth looks and functions. It can also change the look of your face.</p>
    <p>For this reason, we offer bridges to help fill in the gaps. Bridges with artificial teeth can get your mouth back to its correct shape and functioning as it should.</p>
    <p>There are a lot of options when it come to bridges. They can be made of different materials, including porcelain, gold, and alloys. You can also get removable or fixed bridges. You can take your removable bridges out yourself to clean them, while your dentist will have to remove fixed bridges. Fixed ones are implanted right to your jaw or under your gums.</p>
    <p>It is always important to have a thorough examination with x-rays. After that, we will be able to discuss your options so we can make the right choice for your mouth.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about bridges or think you might need one, don’t hesitate to contact us today at (360) 671-4552.</p>
