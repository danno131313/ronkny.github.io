            <p>Though many people worry about their weight when they eat, they don’t think twice about what their diet is doing to their dental health. You need to have healthy eating habits to ensure that your dental health is as good as possible. Just by watching what you put into your mouth, you can decrease the amount of decay and gum disease you develop.</p>

    <p>The American Dental Association recommends avoiding foods high in sugar and other foods that can cause cavities.</p>
    <p>So to have better oral health, you should probably change your diet, though you should always consult a doctor before starting a new diet. If you have special dietary needs, you need to talk to your dentist about foods that you can eat to help with your oral health.</p>
    <p>The American Dental Association has several recommendations for a healthy diet. You should drink plenty of water instead of sugary drinks. You need to avoid sugary food and snacks between meals. You should try to eat a balanced diet full of nutrients from each food group including whole grains, vegetables, dairy, and protein. This mindful eating could also help you drop some weight too!</p>
    <p>Besides eating well, you need to brush your teeth at least twice daily with a soft-bristled toothbrush. You need to floss at least once a day and visit your dentist at least twice a year to ensure that your mouth is as healthy as possible.</p>
