            <p>Maintaining good dental health requires more than just routine dental visits. It is important that you learn to care for your teeth properly at home.</p>
            <p>Most people use manual toothbrushes to clean their teeth to stop debris from building up on their teeth. However, electric toothbrushes have become more popular especially in the past few years.</p>

    <p>People often wonder which toothbrush is better, but the American Dental Association does not have a preference or endorse one as better than the other. As long as you brush your teeth well, either one can be quite effective. Even so, electric toothbrushes can be better because of the rapid movements they use.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about which type of toothbrush is better for you, ask your dentist for advice. Many recommend electric toothbrushes with an oscillating head. There are also brushes that have a timer so you know when you are finished brushing.</p>
    <p>Whether you use an electric or manual toothbrush, you need to find a toothbrush that is the right size for your mouth. You need to be able to reach all of your teeth and get behind your back teeth. If you choose a toothbrush that is too big, you may have trouble getting all of the plaque off your teeth.</p>
    <p>Many worry about the cost of electric toothbrushes. They don’t want to have to buy a new one every three to four months. Though it is important to change an electric toothbrush as regularly as you do a manual one, most electric toothbrushes allow you to change just the head, so changing it regularly won’t be as expensive as you might think.</p>
