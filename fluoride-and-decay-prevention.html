            <p>Here at Bellingham Smiles, we are dedicated to the prevention of tooth decay.</p>
            <p>We believe that fluoride works well to strengthen children’s teeth. It also has been shown to help prevent decay in people of all ages.</p>
            <p>For this reason, the American Dental Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Medical Association believe that topical fluoride is necessary for good oral health.</p>

    <p>Because of this, you may be wondering if you need fluoride treatments. Many times, water is enhanced with fluoride, so additional fluoride treatments are not necessary. However, if your water is not treated, you may need fluoride treatments. You may also need a fluoride treatment if you are showing symptoms like receding gums. You may also want to get treated if you wear braces or are taking medications that cause dry mouth.</p>
    <p>Fluoride treatments can be completed at your routine dental appointment. They are painless and quick, taking only a few minutes. When getting treated, your dentist will apply gel, foam, or varnish on your teeth. Treatment works best if it is done one to four times a year.</p>
    <p>You may wonder what else you need to do in addition to getting regular fluoride treatments. The American Dental Association recommends drinking fluoridated water and using a toothpaste with fluoride.</p>
