    <h1>How To Brush Your Teeth</h1>
    <p>Here at Bellingham Smiles, we know and understand the importance of good preventive care. Part of this includes brushing and flossing your teeth properly.</p>
    <p>Good dental preventive care is really important to ensure a healthy mouth with healthy gums and teeth.</p>
    <p>It is important to brush your teeth at least twice daily to help remove plaque and food particles that get stuck in your teeth. It is recommended that you brush your teeth for at least two minutes, though most people rush through this time. You need to make sure you reach every side of each tooth, including the inside and outside. To help keep your breath fresh, you should also brush your tongue. Then you can begin flossing.</p>
