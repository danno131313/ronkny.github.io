    <h1>How To Floss Your Teeth</h1>
    <p>Here at Bellingham Smiles, we know and understand the importance of good preventive care. Part of this includes brushing and flossing your teeth properly.</p>
    <p>Good dental preventive care is really important to ensure a healthy mouth with healthy gums and teeth.</p>
    <p>The American Dental Association recommends that you floss your teeth at least once daily. Flossing is done to remove plaque that gets stuck in between your teeth. It also gets rid of any plaque that your toothbrush missed or couldn’t get to! If you don’t floss, you will have more problems with tartar, cavities, and even gum disease.</p>
    <p>Though many people hate to do it, flossing is really necessary. You can use dental floss or even a pick specially designed for flossing. Though flossing shouldn’t be painful, it can feel different and awkward at first, but it is important to keep at it. After a few days or weeks, it will become part of your dental routine.</p>
