            <p>Here at Bellingham Smiles, we are proud to offer dental inlays and onlays to our patients.</p>
            <p>Even though many people are concerned about the health of their mouths, it can be quite expensive to get the mouth you deserve.</p>
            <p>For this reason, we are proud to offer dental inlays and onlays. This is a conservative way to treat any teeth that are damaged or injured. It is much cheaper than placing a crown over the top of your tooth.</p>

    <p>Dental inlays and onlays can also be used for cavities and decay. Instead of trying to fill in the tooth, we may just place an inlay or onlay.</p>
    <p>Dental inlays and onlays are specifically made to fit your teeth. They are made in a laboratory, and then we bond them right to your teeth.</p>
    <p>The only difference between inlays and onlays is how much of your tooth we have to cover. If the material is bonded to the center of the tooth, it is considered an inlay. If it covers your whole tooth or more than just one point of your tooth, it is considered an onlay.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about dental inlays or onlays, donâ€™t hesitate to contact us today at (360) 671-4552.</p>
