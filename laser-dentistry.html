            <p>Here at Bellingham Smiles, we are proud to offer laser dentistry to our patients.</p>
            <p>Laser dentistry is not very common, though there are many benefits to using a laser during procedures. Wounds from the surgery heal much faster because there is less damage to the surrounding tissue. Lasers minimize bleeding and post-surgical bacterial infections. Often anesthesia and sutures are not needed after procedures when a laser is used.</p>

    <p>Lasers can be used for many different dental procedures. Using them is an efficient way to find cavities. Fillings don’t need anesthesia when we use a laser. Lasers can be used to remold gums that grow up and over a patient’s teeth. Many dentists use a laser for dental surgery, like cutting out extra tissue in the mouth, removing tumors, and much more.</p>
    <p>Laser dentistry makes procedures much smoother, more efficient, and less painful for patients. People who are afraid or very anxious at the dentist should find dentists who offer laser dentistry. They will be surprised at how painless going to the dentist can be.</p>
    <p>We are dedicated to staying on top of the latest developments in dental medicine, and we do this by offering laser dentistry.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about laser dentistry or how we can help your smile, don’t hesitate to contact us today at (360) 671-4552.</p>
