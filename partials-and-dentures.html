            <p>Partial dentures are used when a patient still has some viable teeth in his or her mouth. These dentures are replacement teeth that are attached to a gum-colored base. Partial dentures are sometimes connected to a metal framework so that they stay in a person’s mouth. Many are cemented to your teeth so that they don’t move. Some people prefer dentures that are removable.</p>

    <p>Partial dentures are used to fill in the areas where there are missing teeth so a patient has a more natural smile. It also helps to keep the remaining teeth in the correct position in their mouth. It is always our goal to give you a smile that you can be proud of!</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about partial dentures or would like to be seen at our office, feel free to contact us today at (360) 671-4552.</p>
