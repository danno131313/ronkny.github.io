            <h2>STOP STRESSING AND START LIVING.</h2>
            <p><b>Your sleep, diet, mood and energy level are all affected by the amount of stress in your life. With the NuCalm® system, stress management is as simple as flipping a switch.</b></p>
            <p>Stress negatively impacts your sleep, your mood, your diet, how you look, and how you feel. Stress also impacts you on a cellular level and is the pre-cursor to most disease states. Each of us copes with stress in different ways, but the impact of stress on cells and internal systems is universally damaging. It is critical to your health to effectively manage stress, maintain balance, and increase resilience.</p>

    <p>NuCalm® is a patented neuroscience technology clinically proven to lower stress and improve sleep quality without drugs. NuCalm gives you the power and control to slow down and recharge when you need it. By guiding you to deep relaxation – NuCalm allows your mind and body to relax, recover, and restore. On NuCalm your body idles in the optimal healing state. This allows you to recover and rebuild quickly. The physiological benefits of deep relaxation include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduced stress (lowers cortisol production)</li>
        <li>Improved sleep quality</li>
        <li>Improved immune system, heart health, and respiratory health</li>
        <li>Improved attention and memory</li>
        <li>Normalized circadian rhythms</li>
        <li>Enhanced creativity and focus</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>NuCalm is serving people across the globe with a singular purpose: to lower stress and improve sleep quality without drugs. The development of NuCalm began in 2002 and was recently awarded the first and only patent for “systems and methods for balancing and maintaining the health of the human autonomic nervous system.”</b></p>
    <h2>PLACE YOUR MIND AND BODY IN THE RESTORATION ZONE.</h2>
    <p>NuCalm rapidly, safely, and predictably creates deep relaxation by mimicking patterns our brains recognize to help relax. This technology works naturally with the two channels of communication in the body — biochemical and electrical.</p>
    <p>NuCalm is comprised of four scientifically sequenced components that synergistically work on the GABAergic system to interrupt the adrenaline response and rapidly guide the brain to a deeply relaxed state. The four-step process includes:</p>
    <p><b>NuCalm Topical Cream</b> - Proprietary formulation of inhibitory neurotransmitters (amino acids) that interrupt the adrenaline response and prepare the brain for relaxation. The all-natural ingredients are hypoallergenic and regulated as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the FDA.</p>
    <p><b>NuCalm Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES)</b> - A sub-sensory microcurrent is used to catalyze the effectiveness of the topical cream to interrupt the body’s natural stress response. Research shows CES helps balance the brain’s neurochemistry by reestablishing optimal neurotransmitter levels. The FDA cleared this Class III medical device in 1988 for the treatment of anxiety, depression, and insomnia.</p>
    <p><b>NuCalm Neuroacoustic Software</b> - Proprietary frequency-following response, neuroacoustic software that entrains brain wave function to Alpha and Theta frequencies (12Hz-4Hz).</p>
    <p><b>NuCalm Light-Blocking Eye Mask</b> - Blocks visual stimulation and maintains the relaxed state.</p>
    <h3>4 Simple Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Apply NuCalm cream.</li>
        <li>Apply a CES patch behind each ear and use microcurrent to facilitate relaxation.</li>
        <li>Fit headphones, turn on NuCalm software, and adjust volume.</li>
        <li>Put on eye mask or glasses.</li>
    </ol>
