            <p>Here at Bellingham Smiles, we are proud to offer root canals for our patients.</p>
            <p>Root canals are done to repair and save teeth that infected or decayed when a filling won’t work We also perform root canals on teeth that have suffered damage from blunt force trauma.</p>
            <p>When performing a root canal, we remove the dead nerve from your tooth. However, we don’t stop there. We also seal off the nerve to prevent another infection from happening and to prevent an abscess from forming around your tooth.</p>

    <p>If you don’t get a root canal, the tooth decay will just continue or the infection will get worse. It may even go deep into your gums which can be quite painful. You may also notice swelling and discomfort.</p>
    <p>If you have a painful tooth, it is important to see a dentist as soon as you can. The longer you wait, the more treatment will be necessary. You may be in pain until we are able to fix the problem.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about root canals, don’t hesitate to contact us today at (360) 671-4552.</p>
