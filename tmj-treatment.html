                If you have TMJ, it probably started with pain and discomfort in your jaw joint and the muscles that are used to move your jaw. Pain and discomfort does not always signal a problem and it usually goes away.

        However, if you are having headaches, trouble chewing, and pain in the face, jaw, and ear, you may be having symptoms of TMJ. Some people complain about an uncomfortable bite. Some even feel pain in their neck and get dizzy.

        Most people try to treat the symptoms at home with pain relievers and ice packs. However, dentists can help you if your home remedies are not working. We often suggest trying guards, though you may need surgery or implants.
